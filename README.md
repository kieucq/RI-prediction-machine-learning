# Machine learning Prediction of Rapid Intensification

This repository contains machine-learning workflows for tropical cyclone rapid intensification (RI) prediction using SHIPS/HWRF-style environmental predictors. The project includes training datasets, individual storm case files, pre-trained Keras models, exploratory notebooks, and scripts used to evaluate Hurricane Otis (2023), Hurricane Patricia (2015), and 2023 real-time forecast cases.

The central research question is how environmental predictors at the RI onset time compare with predictors along the future 24-hour tropical cyclone track for RI classification. The current workflow treats RI as a binary classification problem and trains or evaluates three neural-network-style classifiers including 1) dense logistic-style neural network, 2) simple recurrent neural network (RNN, 3) gated recurrent unit (GRU). The code uses SHIPS diagnostic predictors from HWRF/HAFS-style forecast guidance. The main 24-hour dataset includes predictors at 00, 06, 12, 18, and 24 h lead times. The Otis and Patricia case files are used to compare a failed RI forecast case against a better-predicted RI case and to test sensitivity to SST, shear, and storm translation speed.

## How To Run

Create a Python environment. TensorFlow is the heaviest dependency, so a conda environment is usually the most reliable option on HPC systems.

```bash
conda create -n ri-prediction python=3.10
conda activate ri-prediction
conda install -c conda-forge numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter ipython
python -m pip install tensorflow requests wget
python -m pip install -e .
```

A pip-only installation can start with:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install -e .
```

Run from the repository root.

Train the main 24-hour models:

```bash
python scripts/train_ri_models.py
```

Evaluate the Hurricane Otis case with the pre-trained models:

```bash
python scripts/predict_otis.py
```

Run the combined training and Otis sensitivity workflow used by the job scripts:

```bash
python scripts/train_and_predict_otis.py
```

Open notebooks:

```bash
jupyter lab notebooks/
```

Fetch SHIPS diagnostics for a storm lifetime example:

```bash
python scripts/fetch_ship.py lifetime 13 PATRICIA20E 2015102106
```

On IU HPC systems, job templates are in `jobs/`. They now change into the repository root relative to the job-script location and call the moved scripts.

## Data And Models

The main training file used by the current scripts is:

- `data/training/SHIP_allbasin_2011_2022_Version4.csv`

The main case-study files are:

- `data/cases/OTIS18E_master.csv`
- `data/cases/PATRICIA20E_master.csv`

Pre-trained Keras files are stored in `models/pretrained/` for both 00 h and 24 h experiments:

- `RI_model_logistics_00h.keras`, `RI_model_RNN_00h.keras`, `RI_model_GRU_00h.keras`
- `RI_model_logistics_24h.keras`, `RI_model_RNN_24h.keras`, `RI_model_GRU_24h.keras`
